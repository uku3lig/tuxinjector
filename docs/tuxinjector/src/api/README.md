# Lua API Reference

Tuxinjector is configured using the [Lua](https://lua.org) programming language. If you haven't used
Lua before, these are good starting points:

  - [Programming in Lua](https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html)
  - [Lua 5.1 Reference Manual](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/)

> [!CAUTION]
> Lua code executed by tuxinjector is allowed to interact with the host operating
> system in various ways, such as spawning subprocesses. Read other people's code
> and do not blindly copy and paste it into your own configuration. *cough* gore *cough*

# Configuration

By default, tuxinjector reads and executes a configuration file from
`~/.config/tuxinjector/init.lua`.

The config file has to return a table with all the display, input, overlay,
hotkey, and mode settings. You can also use the API module to register keybindings and call runtime functions:

```lua
local tx = require("tuxinjector")

-- Register keybindings (config-time)
tx.bind("ctrl+F1", function()
    tx.switch_mode("Thin")
end)

-- Return config table
return {
    display = { ... },
    input = { ... },
    overlays = { ... },
    modes = { ... },
}
```

# Hot reload

Tuxinjector watches for changes to `init.lua` within the configuration directory.
When it detects a change, it will automatically reload your configuration. The
Lua VM is destroyed and recreated, so any state within will not be transferred
to the new configuration.
